# Internship Demo 2 decompilation
- A decompilation of the leaked second demo of salty_kvas' "Internship"
- I am not affiliated with salty_kvas, invice or anyone within the Internship team.
- The decomp has no modifications asides from ***some*** organization.

# Notes
At the time of writing this, theres a minor issue regarding doors and hallways, this being the fact that they still use **Numbered Rooms**, which might make the game break in some way after attempting to import rooms.

# Requirements
- [Gamemaker 2023.6](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2023.6.0.92.exe) or [higher](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html) (2023.6 should work best as it is what the decomp was made in)

- (**OPTIONAL**) A brain.
